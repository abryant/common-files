My set of common files (mainly config files and scripts).
-Anthony Bryant.

To install, clone from your home folder and run:
~/common-files/setup

Warning: read the setup script before running it!

Running setup will replace all of the config files it maintains with symlinks
to the checked-out versions. It will also replace ~/scripts with a symlink.
